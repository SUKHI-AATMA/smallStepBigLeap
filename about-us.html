                    Our indulgences often lead to a consistent neglect of our most prized assets - <i class="">body</i>
                    and <i>mind</i>.<i>What we eat has a direct bearing on how we feel and think.</i>

                        <p>At SSBL, we believe in a diligent adaption and practice of two age old adages - <i>‘Health is
                                Wealth’</i> and <i>‘Prevention is better than Cure’</i>. Together, they perfectly
                            complement to articulate our thinking.</p>
                        <p> Amidst the hectic lifestyles we lead, most of us are caught between either of the following
                            conundrums.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Eating has become a tick mark activity, just necessary to satiate hunger rather than
                                fulfil the
                                nutritional needs that our body craves.</li>
                            <li>‘Live to eat’ rather than ‘eat to live’- By becoming slaves to our taste buds, we are
                                unable to
                                ‘eat right’ even when aware that we are ‘eating wrong’</li>
                            <li>Crash diets, short term plans help address weight related challenges only temporarily.
                                They
                                reappear after some time</li>
                            <li>Relying on self-study, guidance from friends and family to plan family meals which we
                                believe/think are nutritious and balanced</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>A holistic solution to hasten recovery from any health challenges being faced</li>
                            <li>An effective catalyst for leading a wholesome, happy, confident and healthy life</li>

My holistic, sustainable healing empowered me to Celebrate Life once again!</p>
                    <p>This miracle that I experienced inspired me to unravel and share the ‘Power of Nutrition’. Quitting the corporate sector, I indulged headlong in my new passion by acquiring requisite qualifications in this field i.e. M.Sc. in Dietetics and a teacher’s training certification in Yoga.</p>
                    <p>Working with a leading hospital chain, I engaged with patients suffering from myriad ailments and observed the difference that a nutritive diet made in their recovery. Better the nutrition, faster the recovery and in some cases just the right diet was the medicine. </p>
                    <p>The mantra to stay happy is very simple - just take a Small Step to nourish your body with nutritious food, enjoy a regular physical activity of choice and keep your mind constructively engaged to for a richer, happier life.</p>
                    <p>By starting Small Step Big Leap, I am taking a small step to share my experience and learning towards creating awareness about the significance of focusing on ‘self’. I am joined in this endeavour by a team eminent experts. We share the common belief that happiness and wellbeing are two sides of the same coin. </p>
                    <p>We aspire to help people rediscover happiness and Celebrate Life! Our ‘small step’, we hope, will result in a ‘BIG LEAP’ towards creating a happier society and a healthier nation.</p>
