                    Our indulgences often lead to a consistent neglect of our most prized assets - <i class="">body</i>
                    and <i>mind</i>.<i>What we eat has a direct bearing on how we feel and think.</i>

                        <p>At SSBL, we believe in a diligent adaption and practice of two age old adages - <i>‘Health is
                                Wealth’</i> and <i>‘Prevention is better than Cure’</i>. Together, they perfectly
                            complement to articulate our thinking.</p>
                        <p> Amidst the hectic lifestyles we lead, most of us are caught between either of the following
                            conundrums.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Eating has become a tick mark activity, just necessary to satiate hunger rather than
                                fulfil the
                                nutritional needs that our body craves.</li>
                            <li>‘Live to eat’ rather than ‘eat to live’- By becoming slaves to our taste buds, we are
                                unable to
                                ‘eat right’ even when aware that we are ‘eating wrong’</li>
                            <li>Crash diets, short term plans help address weight related challenges only temporarily.
                                They
                                reappear after some time</li>
                            <li>Relying on self-study, guidance from friends and family to plan family meals which we
                                believe/think are nutritious and balanced</li>

                            <li>A holistic solution to hasten recovery from any health challenges being faced</li>
                            <li>An effective catalyst for leading a wholesome, happy, confident and healthy life</li>

                    An MBA by qualification, I spent the first two decades of my career in the ever demanding corporate
                    sector within the IT industry with some blue chip names – Wipro, Tata Communication, Gartner,
                    MindTree. I have experienced and closely witnessed the adoption of quick fix measures – pop a pill
                    when feeling sick, grab a smoke or drink to ease stress, skip a meal or over eat as time permits,
                    and the havoc they created in my body over time.
                </p>
                <p>Chronic deficiency of macro and micro nutrients resulted in severe health issues and made the basic
                    need of a good night’s sleep an unattainable luxury. Visits to several doctors and specialists, a
                    battery of diagnostic tests and several rounds of medication followed. But at best they provided
                    intermittent, short term relief while making my body weaker...

                        learned from years of experience as the mother of a child with autism. I am eager to show
                        parents
                        with special-needs’ children that it is truly a blessing, through and through, in no disguise
                        whatsoever. I wish to become that medium through which the miracle of transformation can be
                        enkindled in the lives of people who need that loving, compassionate, nurturing, and motherly
                        touch.
                        I don’t want to remain as someone who shows the silver-lining but be the one who shows them and
                        walks with them to the light.”</p>
